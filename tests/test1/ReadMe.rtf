\f0\fs24 \cf0 This directory contains test programs for your project. You will need to translate the programs into the syntax of your programming language. In most cases the only translation needed will be for the I/O and exponentiation. During your demonstration I will ask you to compile and run some of these test programs (based on the compiler features you tell me you have completed). I can also ask you to compile and run some test programs that you created.\
